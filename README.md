I finished this programming assignment on April 17, 2020 for Dr.Tyson McMillan's Programming Fundamentals 2 class at the TCC 
trinity river campus. This assignment was really fun to make. I learned a ton about classes from reading the Gaddis Textbook and 
through trial and error. I definitely am feeling that learning curve and starting to see the long journey before me, and also 
the progress I have made, and just having a better sense of where I am at as far as programming is concerned.
